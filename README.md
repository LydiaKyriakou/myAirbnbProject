# Get A Room

This project was developed within the course "Technologies Internet Applications" at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. "Get A Room", is a website on which everyone with their entrance has the possibility to browse and to search for housing adapted to his preferences. The website also offers the registered user the possibility to rent a rental from approved hosts, submit reviews, chat with the host of each rental as well as providing personalized proposals. The approved hosts on the other hand can import and modify the spaces for rent as well as to chat with the users. Finally the administrator approves the hosts and can produce database files.

The project consists of two parts:
- The front end (front-end), which was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4.
- The back-end, which has been implemented with Spring-Boot
